# House_Price_Prediction_MLOps

This project implements an advanced Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) pipeline for predicting house prices. It integrates traditional property features (location, size, and number of rooms) with a novel feature: **house condition**. The pipeline uses Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for data management, Apache Airflow for orchestration, and Data Version Control (DVC) for tracking data versions and model iterations.

# **Running MLflow UI in an Airflow Container**

This guide explains how to run the **MLflow UI** from an Airflow container in a Dockerized environment. It assumes you already have an Airflow setup running using `docker-compose` and MLflow installed in the containers via `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS`.

---

## **Prerequisites**

1. **Airflow Setup**: Ensure your Airflow containers are running and properly configured in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
2. **MLflow Installed**: MLflow should be included in the `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS` of your Airflow setup:
   ```yaml
   _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS: "mlflow pandas scikit-learn kneed google-cloud-storage"
   ```
3. **Shared Volume**: The `mlruns` directory should be mounted to `/opt/airflow/mlruns` for consistent tracking:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./mlruns:/opt/airflow/mlruns
   ```

---

## **Steps to Run MLflow UI**

### **1. Start Airflow Containers**
Start your Airflow setup:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Ensure all containers are running:
```bash
docker ps
```

### **2. Access the Desired Container**
Decide which Airflow container will host the MLflow UI. Typically, this will be the **worker** or **webserver** container. Enter the container:
```bash
docker exec -it airflow-airflow-worker-1 bash
```
*(Replace `airflow-airflow-worker-1` with the name of the desired container.)*

### **3. Start the MLflow UI**
Inside the container, start the MLflow UI:
```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri postgresql+psycopg2://airflow:airflow@postgres/mlflow --host 0.0.0.0
```

- **`--backend-store-uri`**: Specifies the location of the MLflow tracking directory.
- **`--host`**: Ensures the UI is accessible from outside the container.

### **4. Access the MLflow UI**
The UI will be available at:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

If port **5000** is already in use, you can specify a different port:
```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri file:///opt/airflow/mlruns --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001
```
Ensure the port is mapped in your `docker-compose.yaml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "5001:5001"
```

---

## **Stopping the MLflow UI**

### **1. If Running in the Foreground**
Stop the process by pressing:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### **2. If Running in the Background**
Find the MLflow process ID (PID) and terminate it:
```bash
ps aux | grep 'mlflow'
kill <PID>
```

---

## **Notes**

- For modular setups, consider running the MLflow UI in a dedicated container for better scalability and separation of concerns.
- Make sure the `mlruns` directory is shared between the container running the MLflow UI and the container where Airflow logs experiments.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

1. **Cannot Access MLflow UI**:
   - Verify that port **5000** is mapped correctly in the `docker-compose.yaml`.
   - Check if another process is using port **5000**:
     ```bash
     sudo ss -tuln | grep 5000
     ```

2. **Permission Issues**:
   Ensure the `mlruns` directory has the correct permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 ./mlruns
   ```

---

# Troubleshooting `init-db.sh` Script in Docker Compose

This guide helps you troubleshoot issues related to the execution of the `init-db.sh` script in a Docker Compose setup, specifically for initializing a PostgreSQL database.

## Common Issues and Resolutions

### 1. File Permissions
Ensure the `init-db.sh` file has executable permissions.

**Command to check permissions:**  
```bash
ls -l init-db.sh
```

Expected output:  
```bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user group size date init-db.sh
```

If permissions are incorrect, run:  
```bash
chmod +x init-db.sh
```

### 2. Line Endings
Ensure the script has Unix line endings. Windows-style line endings can cause syntax errors in the container.

**Convert to Unix format:**  
Install `dos2unix` (if not already installed):  
```bash
sudo apt install dos2unix
```

Run the conversion:  
```bash
dos2unix init-db.sh
```

### 3. Correct Placement in Docker Compose
Ensure the script is mounted correctly in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Example:  
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    volumes:
      - ./scripts/init-db.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-db.sh
```

### 4. Script Debugging
If the script fails to execute, check the logs of the PostgreSQL container:  
```bash
docker logs <postgres-container-id>
```

Manually execute the script inside the container to debug errors:  
```bash
docker exec -it <postgres-container-id> bash
bash /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-db.sh
```

### 5. Confirm Database Initialization
Check if the `mlflow` database was successfully created:  
```bash
docker exec -it airflow-postgres-1 psql -U airflow
\l
```

The output should list `mlflow` as one of the databases.

## Sample `init-db.sh` Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check if the database has already been initialized
if [ ! -f "/var/lib/postgresql/data/.db_initialized" ]; then
  echo "Initializing database..."
  psql -U airflow -c "CREATE DATABASE mlflow;"
  psql -U airflow -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mlflow TO airflow;"
  touch /var/lib/postgresql/data/.db_initialized
else
  echo "Database already initialized."
fi
```

## Notes
- Ensure the `init-db.sh` script is idempotent to avoid issues during multiple runs.
- The `.db_initialized` file acts as a flag to ensure the database initialization runs only once.

## Contact
If you encounter further issues, consult the Docker and PostgreSQL documentation or reach out for support.


# Methodology for House Price Prediction

This folder documents the methodology used in the House Price Prediction project, detailing the steps taken to process data, select features, and develop a robust model. The dataset used is **AmesHousing.csv**.

---

## 1. Introduction

The methodology outlined here serves as a guide to understanding the reasoning behind data processing, feature selection, and model preparation for predicting house prices. Each decision was made with the goal of improving model accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. 

For detailed data definitions, refer to this [Data Definition Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XL6LJVgLLU27yV7a_oh2zuqhGOI3Syg-jWpmr0Ekk14/edit?usp=sharing).

---

## 2. Data Processing Methods

### Overview of the Dataset
- **Dimensions**: 82 columns, 2930 rows
- **Data Types**:
  - `float64`: 11 columns
  - `int64`: 28 columns
  - `object`: 43 columns

The dataset includes a balanced mix of quantitative variables (e.g., year built, number of fireplaces) and qualitative variables (e.g., heating quality, exterior quality).

### Data Validation
We validated the dataset using information from the [Data Documentation](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt). Key steps included:
1. **Outlier Removal**: Houses with over 4000 square feet were excluded to avoid skewing the model.
2. **Data Correction**: Corrected a record where the garage build year was incorrectly listed as 2207, changing it to 2007.

### Handling Missing Values and Duplicates
- **Duplicates**: No duplicate records were identified in the dataset.
- **Missing Values**:
   - **Numerical Variables**: Handled based on variable type:
      - Filled with `0` for features like basement full bathroom and total basement square feet.
      - Used the median for continuous features like lot frontage and garage cars.
   - **Categorical Variables**: Standardized all `NA`, empty, or `None` values to "Missing" for consistency.

### Data Saving
The cleaned dataset was saved as `cleaned_data.csv` to ensure reproducibility and facilitate alternative encoding methods if needed.

---

## 3. Feature Engineering

To prepare categorical features for modeling, we applied label encoding. The encoding was customized based on feature types and scales:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Encoded all "Missing" values as `0`.
2. **Feature Grouping and Encoding**:
   - **Quality-related Features**: Encoded on a scale from 1 to 5, ranging from Poor to Excellent, covering 10 features.
   - **Good-to-Bad Features**: Assigned values from low to high quality across 7 features.
   - **Other Features**: Encoded appropriately based on their role in modeling.

After encoding, we saved the transformed dataset as `encoding_data.csv` for modeling use.

---

## 4. Data Splitting

The processed data was split into training and test sets with an 85/15 ratio. This larger training set size enhances model learning, particularly given the limited dataset size. To maintain an unbiased evaluation, we applied data augmentation only to the training data, leaving the test set untouched as a representative sample for real-world cases.

---

## 5. Feature Selection

After data splitting, we identified relevant features for predicting SalePrice using two methods:

### *1. Correlation Analysis*
   - We focused on features with a Pearson’s r correlation coefficient of at least 0.3 with SalePrice. This threshold balances relevance with simplicity, retaining features with moderate associations without over-complicating the model.

### *2. Lasso Regression*
   - To refine feature selection further, we applied Lasso regression, using LassoCV to find the optimal regularization level. Standardized features were used to ensure consistent scaling. We set a high importance threshold of 0.1, and only one feature was removed, reinforcing the relevance of those identified in the correlation analysis.

---

## 6. Data Augmentation

The selected features were passed through the `augment_data_with_perturbations` function for data augmentation, which introduces slight variations in key features. This approach is intended to enhance model generalization by simulating small real-world changes in the data. Key augmentation parameters:

- **Perturbation Percentage**: Set at 0.02 to ensure variations remain within 2% of original feature values, maintaining data realism.
- **Augmented Records**: Generated 2000 synthetic records, balancing data diversity with computational efficiency.

---

## 7. Model Selection and Training

For model selection, we experimented with regression, tree-based models, and neural networks. **Lasso regression** and **tree-based models** were chosen for their interpretability and performance. Hyperparameters were fine-tuned to optimize performance while avoiding overfitting.

---

## 8. Evaluation Metrics

To assess model performance, we used **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, as both metrics provide insight into prediction accuracy and error magnitudes. These metrics help in evaluating model generalization and guiding further tuning.

---

## 9. Experimentation and Results

Several experiments were conducted to evaluate feature impact and model configurations. Through these, we achieved:
- An optimal balance between accuracy and complexity.
- Improved performance using data augmentation, which increased model robustness.

```

## Description of Files and Folders

- **project_dvc/**: The main directory of the project where all DVC-related files are stored.
  
- **.dvc/**: Contains DVC configuration and settings files.
  - **config.txt**: Configuration file that includes the settings for DVC in this project.
  - **gitignore.txt**: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore in the `.dvc` folder.
  
- **data/**: This folder contains the datasets used in the project, all tracked by DVC.
  - **AmesHousing.csv.dvc**: DVC-tracked file for the original Ames Housing dataset.
  - **cleaned_data.csv.dvc**: DVC-tracked file for the cleaned version of the dataset after preprocessing.
  - **encoding_data.csv.dvc**: DVC-tracked file for the dataset after encoding categorical variables.
  - **gitignore.txt**: File to specify files in the `data` folder that Git should ignore.
  - **dvcignore.txt**: File to specify files in the `data` folder that DVC should ignore.

## Usage

1. **Setting Up DVC**:
   - Ensure DVC is installed by running `pip install dvc`.
   - Initialize DVC in the project (if not already done) using `dvc init`.

2. **Adding Data Files**:
   - Place raw and processed datasets in the `data/` folder.
   - Track each dataset with DVC by running `dvc add data/<filename>`.
   - This creates `.dvc` files (e.g., `AmesHousing.csv.dvc`) that reference the version-controlled data.

3. **Using gitignore.txt and dvcignore.txt**:
   - `gitignore.txt` is used to prevent specific files in `data/` from being tracked by Git.
   - `dvcignore.txt` helps DVC to ignore files or directories in `data/` that you do not want to track.

4. **Pushing Data to Remote Storage**:
   - Configure a remote storage for DVC using `dvc remote add -d <remote-name> <remote-url>`.
   - Push the data to the remote storage with `dvc push` to back up your datasets.

5. **Pulling Data**:
   - To retrieve data from the remote storage, use `dvc pull`.

## Notes

- Ensure that both `gitignore.txt` and `dvcignore.txt` are properly configured to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
- For collaborative projects, share `.dvc` files and configuration, allowing others to reproduce your work by using `dvc pull` to fetch the data.
