# **MLflow Set up**
In this project, we used MLflow within an Airflow container to track our machine learning experiments. We trained three models for predicting house prices using both categorical and numerical features:

Linear Regression
Random Forest
Elastic Net
After evaluating their performance, we found that the Random Forest model provided the best results for our dataset. All training runs, metrics, and artifacts were logged and visualized through the MLflow UI, which made it easy to compare the models and select the optimal one.

This guide explains how to run the **MLflow UI** from an Airflow container in a Dockerized environment. It assumes you already have an Airflow setup running using `docker-compose` and MLflow installed in the containers via `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/750effb5-34bf-4c72-a9d9-7fb311b043d2)

---

#### **Prerequisites**

**Airflow Setup**: Ensure your Airflow containers are running and properly configured in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
**MLflow Installed**: MLflow should be included in the `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS` of your Airflow setup:
   ```yaml
   _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS: "mlflow pandas scikit-learn kneed google-cloud-storage"
   ```
**Shared Volume**: The `mlruns` directory should be mounted to `/opt/airflow/mlruns` for consistent tracking:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./mlruns:/opt/airflow/mlruns
   ```

---

#### **Steps to Run MLflow UI**

1. **Start Airflow Containers**
Start your Airflow setup:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Ensure all containers are running:
```bash
docker ps
```

2.**Access the Desired Container**
Decide which Airflow container will host the MLflow UI. Typically, this will be the **worker** or **webserver** container. Enter the container:
```bash
docker exec -it airflow-airflow-worker-1 bash
```
*(Replace `airflow-airflow-worker-1` with the name of the desired container.)*

3. **Start the MLflow UI**
Inside the container, start the MLflow UI:
```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri postgresql+psycopg2://airflow:airflow@postgres/mlflow --host 0.0.0.0
```

- **`--backend-store-uri`**: Specifies the location of the MLflow tracking directory.
- **`--host`**: Ensures the UI is accessible from outside the container.

4. **Access the MLflow UI**
The UI will be available at:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

If port **5000** is already in use, you can specify a different port:
```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri file:///opt/airflow/mlruns --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001
```
Ensure the port is mapped in your `docker-compose.yaml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "5001:5001"
```

---

5. **Stopping the MLflow UI**

**If Running in the Foreground**
Stop the process by pressing:
```
Ctrl + C
```

**If Running in the Background**
Find the MLflow process ID (PID) and terminate it:
```bash
ps aux | grep 'mlflow'
kill <PID>
```

**Notes**

- For modular setups, consider running the MLflow UI in a dedicated container for better scalability and separation of concerns.
- Make sure the `mlruns` directory is shared between the container running the MLflow UI and the container where Airflow logs experiments.

---

#### **Troubleshooting**

**Cannot Access MLflow UI**:
   - Verify that port **5000** is mapped correctly in the `docker-compose.yaml`.
   - Check if another process is using port **5000**:
     ```bash
     sudo ss -tuln | grep 5000
     ```
**Permission Issues**:
   Ensure the `mlruns` directory has the correct permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 ./mlruns
   ```

---

#### Troubleshooting `init-db.sh` Script in Docker Compose

This guide helps you troubleshoot issues related to the execution of the `init-db.sh` script in a Docker Compose setup, specifically for initializing a PostgreSQL database.

#### Common Issues and Resolutions

1.**File Permissions**
Ensure the `init-db.sh` file has executable permissions.

2.**Command to check permissions:**  
```bash
ls -l init-db.sh
```

Expected output:  
```bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user group size date init-db.sh
```

If permissions are incorrect, run:  
```bash
chmod +x init-db.sh
```

# Data Validation and Data Shift Detection

To ensure high-quality data processing and robust model training, the project incorporates automated **Data Validation** and **Data Shift Detection** mechanisms. These processes leverage **TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)** and custom Cloud Functions integrated with **Google Pub/Sub** for real-time tracking of changes to the data folder in the GCS bucket. Notifications are sent via email for critical events.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4199b64-e6be-4a0c-876c-fed11986d7ba)


---

### Data Validation using TFDV

We use **TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)** to validate the dataset during the preprocessing pipeline. TFDV automatically analyzes the dataset to detect anomalies, inconsistencies, and schema violations.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02c56254-e950-463e-b864-cb456579453e)


#### Key Features:
- **Schema Generation**: Defines expected feature types, value ranges, and distributions.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies:
  - Missing or unexpected values.
  - Type mismatches (e.g., numerical features containing non-numeric values).
  - Distributional anomalies (e.g., significant deviations in feature distributions).
- **Statistics Comparison**: Ensures consistency with historical data by comparing feature statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).

#### Workflow:
1. During the **data preprocessing pipeline**, TFDV analyzes the dataset and validates it against the schema.
2. Anomalies detected by TFDV are logged, and an email notification is sent for critical issues.
3. If no anomalies are found, the pipeline proceeds to the next stage.

---

### Data Shift Detection using Cloud Functions

To maintain model reliability, we monitor the **data folder** in the GCS bucket for changes (additions or deletions). A custom **Google Cloud Function** tracks these events in real-time and evaluates potential data drift.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a57684f-d84a-411a-9841-3fc859796662)


#### Pub/Sub Integration:
- A **Pub/Sub topic** is configured to monitor the `data/` folder in the GCS bucket.
- Whenever a new file is added or an existing file is deleted, a message is published to the Pub/Sub topic, triggering the **Data Shift Detection Cloud Function**.

#### Data Drift Detection:
- The Cloud Function compares the statistics of the newly added file with a reference dataset using statistical tests:
  - **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: For numerical features.
  - **Chi-Squared Test**: For categorical features.
- Drift detection logic identifies significant deviations in feature distributions, indicating potential issues with the data pipeline.

#### Workflow:
1. **File Added to GCS**: When a new file is added to the `data/` folder, the Cloud Function:
   - Downloads the new file and the reference dataset.
   - Generates feature statistics for both datasets.
   - Detects drift using statistical tests.
2. **File Deleted from GCS**: If a file is removed, the function logs the event and sends an email notification.

---

# Email Notifications

The Cloud Functions and TFDV processes are configured to send email alerts for critical events:
- **Data Validation Anomalies**:
  - Schema violations (e.g., unexpected feature types).
  - Missing or out-of-range values.
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8644ff1a-d9a6-4224-abe9-84382b040075)

- **Data Drift Detection**:
  - Significant drift in feature distributions.
  - Notifications include a summary of drifted features and the corresponding p-values.
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d6eac52-bbce-40bf-a9fa-98e096fe61c5)

- **File Addition/Deletion**:
  - Alerts are sent whenever files are added to or removed from the `data/` folder.

│   └── dvcignore.txt          # DVC ignore file for excluding certain files from DVC tracking
```

#### Description of Files and Folders

- **project_dvc/**: The main directory of the project where all DVC-related files are stored.
  
- **.dvc/**: Contains DVC configuration and settings files.
  - **config.txt**: Configuration file that includes the settings for DVC in this project.
  - **gitignore.txt**: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore in the `.dvc` folder.
  
- **data/**: This folder contains the datasets used in the project, all tracked by DVC.
  - **AmesHousing.csv.dvc**: DVC-tracked file for the original Ames Housing dataset.
  - **cleaned_data.csv.dvc**: DVC-tracked file for the cleaned version of the dataset after preprocessing.
  - **encoding_data.csv.dvc**: DVC-tracked file for the dataset after encoding categorical variables.
  - **gitignore.txt**: File to specify files in the `data` folder that Git should ignore.
  - **dvcignore.txt**: File to specify files in the `data` folder that DVC should ignore.

#### Set Up

1. **Setting Up DVC**:
   - Ensure DVC is installed by running `pip install dvc`.
   - Initialize DVC in the project (if not already done) using `dvc init`.

2. **Adding Data Files**:
   - Place raw and processed datasets in the `data/` folder.
   - Track each dataset with DVC by running `dvc add data/<filename>`.
   - This creates `.dvc` files (e.g., `AmesHousing.csv.dvc`) that reference the version-controlled data.

3. **Using gitignore.txt and dvcignore.txt**:
   - `gitignore.txt` is used to prevent specific files in `data/` from being tracked by Git.
   - `dvcignore.txt` helps DVC to ignore files or directories in `data/` that you do not want to track.

4. **Pushing Data to Remote Storage**:
   - Configure a remote storage for DVC using `dvc remote add -d <remote-name> <remote-url>`.
   - Push the data to the remote storage with `dvc push` to back up your datasets.

5. **Pulling Data**:
   - To retrieve data from the remote storage, use `dvc pull`.

## Notes

- Ensure that both `gitignore.txt` and `dvcignore.txt` are properly configured to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
- For collaborative projects, share `.dvc` files and configuration, allowing others to reproduce your work by using `dvc pull` to fetch the data.

## Model Sensitivity Analysis
Our implementation centers on SHAP analysis as the primary tool for understanding feature contributions. Using shap.LinearExplainer, we calculate SHAP values for each feature-prediction pair in our linear regression model. The choice of LinearExplainer aligns with our model architecture and provides computationally efficient analysis for large-scale housing datasets.

<img width="651" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07c76a09-f6cb-41ca-a5fe-5a63fc0d8e61">

<img width="664" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56bbd294-d3ae-44bb-b920-d86156385b00">

**Key insights:**
- Feature Importance Key Insights: Zoning and basement features are crucial for house prices, notably:
MS Zoning_RL, Basement Finished Square Feet, Unfinished Basement Area, 
- Sensitivity Analysis:
Roof materials significantly impact model performance when removed, especially Tar & Gravel (1.23e+22).
The StoneBr neighborhood and Overall Condition are also highly sensitive.
- Recommendations
     - Keep roof material features despite lower coefficients.
     - Pay attention to neighborhood effects and feature interactions.
     - Test the impact of seemingly less important features before removal.

The sensitivity analysis framework integrates into our MLOps pipeline between feature selection and data augmentation, allowing us to:
- Validate feature selection.
- Guide data augmentation based on feature stability.
- Inform model training and parameters.
- Support continuous model monitoring.
- It processes numerical and categorical features through standardized scaling and encoding for consistent analysis.


## Model Bias Detection

**Split groups based on key feature**
The main dataset used is the Ames Housing Dataset, which includes details on property features. It includes a total of 82 features. Based on the feature correlation results and the project's objectives, we identified house type as the key feature for analysis. Consequently, the dataset will be split into four distinct groups **based on house type**. 

**Bias detection**
Train a baseline regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) on the entire dataset. Evaluate the model's performance on each house type ('Bldg Type_1Fam', 'Bldg Type_2fmCon', 'Bldg Type_Duplex', 'Bldg Type_Twnhs', 'Bldg Type_TwnhsE') group using standard regression metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), R-squared (R^2)

**Bias result evaluation**
Compare performance metrics across house type groups. Identify significant disparities in prediction errors between groups. For instance, if one house type group consistently shows higher MAE or RMSE, it indicates a potential bias in the model.
<img width="632" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32abb0bc-b444-4fa4-8ad5-b3c729090663">
<img width="643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c121763-a025-4ae8-bd47-feee2fdf7633">

**​​Disparities:**
Based on the bias disparity evaluation result, some disparities in model performance across different building types.
Significant disparities exist in MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² values across groups.
Bldg Type_2fmCon has the worst R², indicating severe issues with model predictions for this category.
Bldg Type_Duplex has relatively low errors and decent R², suggesting better model performance for this group.
Bias mitigation strategies were implemented to address identified disparities. These included:
Data reaugmentation: Run a data balancing check to verify the representation of each group, very bad performance at Bldg Type_2fmCon might because less data. So we will augment the dataset based on split groups, so each group can have a relatively equal amount of data.
Feature Rebalancing: Adjusting feature weights to ensure equal representation across house types.
Model changing: Choose different models and test which one has the best and balanced performance among different groups.
Model Tuning: Optimizing hyperparameters to minimize group-specific errors.
