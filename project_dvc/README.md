# Airflow Pipeline Setup and Usage

This document provides instructions for setting up, running, and troubleshooting the Airflow-based data pipeline for the **House Price Prediction MLOps** project. Apache Airflow orchestrates various ETL processes and machine learning workflows, ensuring modular, scalable, and efficient data processing.

---

## 1. Introduction

The Airflow pipeline automates the end-to-end data processing and machine learning workflow for the House Price Prediction project. Key stages in the pipeline include:
- **Data acquisition** from Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- **Data preprocessing** (cleaning, validation, splitting)
- **Feature engineering** and **data augmentation**
- **Model training** and **evaluation**
- **Artifact storage** and version control using DVC

---

## 2. Pipeline Overview

The pipeline consists of modular DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) that run specific tasks in a sequence to process data, train models, and track outputs. Each DAG is designed to operate independently, allowing for flexibility in updating and testing individual components.

### DAGs Included:
- **data_prep_dag**: Handles data loading, validation, cleaning, and splitting.
- **feature_and_augm_dag**: Performs feature engineering and data augmentation.

# **Running MLflow UI in an Airflow Container for Experiment Tracking**
In this project, we used MLflow within an Airflow container to track our machine learning experiments. We trained three models for predicting house prices using both categorical and numerical features:

Linear Regression
Random Forest
Elastic Net
After evaluating their performance, we found that the Random Forest model provided the best results for our dataset. All training runs, metrics, and artifacts were logged and visualized through the MLflow UI, which made it easy to compare the models and select the optimal one.

This guide explains how to run the **MLflow UI** from an Airflow container in a Dockerized environment. It assumes you already have an Airflow setup running using `docker-compose` and MLflow installed in the containers via `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/750effb5-34bf-4c72-a9d9-7fb311b043d2)

---

## **Prerequisites**

1. **Airflow Setup**: Ensure your Airflow containers are running and properly configured in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
2. **MLflow Installed**: MLflow should be included in the `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS` of your Airflow setup:
   ```yaml
   _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS: "mlflow pandas scikit-learn kneed google-cloud-storage"
   ```
3. **Shared Volume**: The `mlruns` directory should be mounted to `/opt/airflow/mlruns` for consistent tracking:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./mlruns:/opt/airflow/mlruns
   ```

---

## **Steps to Run MLflow UI**

### **1. Start Airflow Containers**
Start your Airflow setup:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Ensure all containers are running:
```bash
docker ps
```

### **2. Access the Desired Container**
Decide which Airflow container will host the MLflow UI. Typically, this will be the **worker** or **webserver** container. Enter the container:
```bash
docker exec -it airflow-airflow-worker-1 bash
```
*(Replace `airflow-airflow-worker-1` with the name of the desired container.)*

### **3. Start the MLflow UI**
Inside the container, start the MLflow UI:
```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri postgresql+psycopg2://airflow:airflow@postgres/mlflow --host 0.0.0.0
```

- **`--backend-store-uri`**: Specifies the location of the MLflow tracking directory.
- **`--host`**: Ensures the UI is accessible from outside the container.

### **4. Access the MLflow UI**
The UI will be available at:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

If port **5000** is already in use, you can specify a different port:
```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri file:///opt/airflow/mlruns --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001
```
Ensure the port is mapped in your `docker-compose.yaml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "5001:5001"
```

---

## **Stopping the MLflow UI**

### **1. If Running in the Foreground**
Stop the process by pressing:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### **2. If Running in the Background**
Find the MLflow process ID (PID) and terminate it:
```bash
ps aux | grep 'mlflow'
kill <PID>
```

---

## **Notes**

- For modular setups, consider running the MLflow UI in a dedicated container for better scalability and separation of concerns.
- Make sure the `mlruns` directory is shared between the container running the MLflow UI and the container where Airflow logs experiments.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

1. **Cannot Access MLflow UI**:
   - Verify that port **5000** is mapped correctly in the `docker-compose.yaml`.
   - Check if another process is using port **5000**:
     ```bash
     sudo ss -tuln | grep 5000
     ```

2. **Permission Issues**:
   Ensure the `mlruns` directory has the correct permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 ./mlruns
   ```

---

# Troubleshooting `init-db.sh` Script in Docker Compose

This guide helps you troubleshoot issues related to the execution of the `init-db.sh` script in a Docker Compose setup, specifically for initializing a PostgreSQL database.

## Common Issues and Resolutions

### 1. File Permissions
Ensure the `init-db.sh` file has executable permissions.

**Command to check permissions:**  
```bash
ls -l init-db.sh
```

Expected output:  
```bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user group size date init-db.sh
```

If permissions are incorrect, run:  
```bash
chmod +x init-db.sh
```

### 2. Line Endings
Ensure the script has Unix line endings. Windows-style line endings can cause syntax errors in the container.

**Convert to Unix format:**  
Install `dos2unix` (if not already installed):  
```bash
sudo apt install dos2unix
```

Run the conversion:  
```bash
dos2unix init-db.sh
```

### 3. Correct Placement in Docker Compose
Ensure the script is mounted correctly in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Example:  
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    volumes:
      - ./scripts/init-db.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-db.sh
```

### 4. Script Debugging
If the script fails to execute, check the logs of the PostgreSQL container:  
```bash
docker logs <postgres-container-id>
```

Manually execute the script inside the container to debug errors:  
```bash
docker exec -it <postgres-container-id> bash
bash /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-db.sh
```

### 5. Confirm Database Initialization
Check if the `mlflow` database was successfully created:  
```bash
docker exec -it airflow-postgres-1 psql -U airflow
\l
```

The output should list `mlflow` as one of the databases.

## Sample `init-db.sh` Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check if the database has already been initialized
if [ ! -f "/var/lib/postgresql/data/.db_initialized" ]; then
  echo "Initializing database..."
  psql -U airflow -c "CREATE DATABASE mlflow;"
  psql -U airflow -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mlflow TO airflow;"
  touch /var/lib/postgresql/data/.db_initialized
else
  echo "Database already initialized."
fi
```

## Notes
- Ensure the `init-db.sh` script is idempotent to avoid issues during multiple runs.
- The `.db_initialized` file acts as a flag to ensure the database initialization runs only once.

## Contact
If you encounter further issues, consult the Docker and PostgreSQL documentation or reach out for support.

## Data Validation and Data Shift Detection

To ensure high-quality data processing and robust model training, the project incorporates automated **Data Validation** and **Data Shift Detection** mechanisms. These processes leverage **TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)** and custom Cloud Functions integrated with **Google Pub/Sub** for real-time tracking of changes to the data folder in the GCS bucket. Notifications are sent via email for critical events.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4199b64-e6be-4a0c-876c-fed11986d7ba)


---

### 1. Data Validation using TFDV

We use **TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)** to validate the dataset during the preprocessing pipeline. TFDV automatically analyzes the dataset to detect anomalies, inconsistencies, and schema violations.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02c56254-e950-463e-b864-cb456579453e)


#### Key Features:
- **Schema Generation**: Defines expected feature types, value ranges, and distributions.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies:
  - Missing or unexpected values.
  - Type mismatches (e.g., numerical features containing non-numeric values).
  - Distributional anomalies (e.g., significant deviations in feature distributions).
- **Statistics Comparison**: Ensures consistency with historical data by comparing feature statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).

#### Workflow:
1. During the **data preprocessing pipeline**, TFDV analyzes the dataset and validates it against the schema.
2. Anomalies detected by TFDV are logged, and an email notification is sent for critical issues.
3. If no anomalies are found, the pipeline proceeds to the next stage.

---

### 2. Data Shift Detection using Cloud Functions

To maintain model reliability, we monitor the **data folder** in the GCS bucket for changes (additions or deletions). A custom **Google Cloud Function** tracks these events in real-time and evaluates potential data drift.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a57684f-d84a-411a-9841-3fc859796662)


#### Pub/Sub Integration:
- A **Pub/Sub topic** is configured to monitor the `data/` folder in the GCS bucket.
- Whenever a new file is added or an existing file is deleted, a message is published to the Pub/Sub topic, triggering the **Data Shift Detection Cloud Function**.

#### Data Drift Detection:
- The Cloud Function compares the statistics of the newly added file with a reference dataset using statistical tests:
  - **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: For numerical features.
  - **Chi-Squared Test**: For categorical features.
- Drift detection logic identifies significant deviations in feature distributions, indicating potential issues with the data pipeline.

#### Workflow:
1. **File Added to GCS**: When a new file is added to the `data/` folder, the Cloud Function:
   - Downloads the new file and the reference dataset.
   - Generates feature statistics for both datasets.
   - Detects drift using statistical tests.
2. **File Deleted from GCS**: If a file is removed, the function logs the event and sends an email notification.

---

### 3. Email Notifications

The Cloud Functions and TFDV processes are configured to send email alerts for critical events:
- **Data Validation Anomalies**:
  - Schema violations (e.g., unexpected feature types).
  - Missing or out-of-range values.
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8644ff1a-d9a6-4224-abe9-84382b040075)

- **Data Drift Detection**:
  - Significant drift in feature distributions.
  - Notifications include a summary of drifted features and the corresponding p-values.
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d6eac52-bbce-40bf-a9fa-98e096fe61c5)

- **File Addition/Deletion**:
  - Alerts are sent whenever files are added to or removed from the `data/` folder.

#### Email Sample:
**Subject**: Data Drift Detected in Latest File  
**Body**:
```
A data drift was detected in the file 'new_data.csv' uploaded to the GCS bucket.

Drift Summary:
- Feature: 'Lot Area'
  Test: Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test
  p-value: 0.001
  Drift Detected: True

- Feature: 'Neighborhood'
  Test: Chi-Squared Test
  p-value: 0.015
  Drift Detected: True

Please review the new data to ensure consistency with the reference dataset.
```

---

### 4. Benefits of Automation

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks changes to the `data/` folder instantly, ensuring quick detection of anomalies or drift.
- **Improved Data Quality**: TFDV ensures that only validated data proceeds to the preprocessing and modeling stages.
- **Early Issue Detection**: Data drift alerts allow for proactive adjustments to maintain model performance and reliability.
- **Seamless Integration**: Leveraging Pub/Sub and Cloud Functions ensures that the system is highly scalable and fault-tolerant.

---

### 5. How to Customize

- **Pub/Sub Topic**: Modify the topic subscription in the Cloud Function to track additional folders or buckets as needed.
- **Email Recipients**: Update the email configuration to include new recipients or modify the alert formats.
- **Drift Sensitivity**: Adjust the p-value threshold in the Cloud Function to control the sensitivity of drift detection.

This automated pipeline ensures data consistency and enhances the reliability of the **House Price Prediction** system, enabling efficient and scalable machine learning operations.

# Methodology for House Price Prediction

This folder documents the methodology used in the House Price Prediction project, detailing the steps taken to process data, select features, and develop a robust model. The dataset used is **AmesHousing.csv**.

---

## 1. Introduction

The methodology outlined here serves as a guide to understanding the reasoning behind data processing, feature selection, and model preparation for predicting house prices. Each decision was made with the goal of improving model accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. 

For detailed data definitions, refer to this [Data Definition Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XL6LJVgLLU27yV7a_oh2zuqhGOI3Syg-jWpmr0Ekk14/edit?usp=sharing).

---

## 2. Data Processing Methods

### Overview of the Dataset
- **Dimensions**: 82 columns, 2930 rows
- **Data Types**:
  - `float64`: 11 columns
  - `int64`: 28 columns
  - `object`: 43 columns

The dataset includes a balanced mix of quantitative variables (e.g., year built, number of fireplaces) and qualitative variables (e.g., heating quality, exterior quality).

### Data Validation
We validated the dataset using information from the [Data Documentation](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt). Key steps included:
1. **Outlier Removal**: Houses with over 4000 square feet were excluded to avoid skewing the model.
2. **Data Correction**: Corrected a record where the garage build year was incorrectly listed as 2207, changing it to 2007.

### Handling Missing Values and Duplicates
- **Duplicates**: No duplicate records were identified in the dataset.
- **Missing Values**:
   - **Numerical Variables**: Handled based on variable type:
      - Filled with `0` for features like basement full bathroom and total basement square feet.
      - Used the median for continuous features like lot frontage and garage cars.
   - **Categorical Variables**: Standardized all `NA`, empty, or `None` values to "Missing" for consistency.

### Data Saving
The cleaned dataset was saved as `cleaned_data.csv` to ensure reproducibility and facilitate alternative encoding methods if needed.

---

## 3. Feature Engineering

To prepare categorical features for modeling, we applied label encoding. The encoding was customized based on feature types and scales:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Encoded all "Missing" values as `0`.
2. **Feature Grouping and Encoding**:
   - **Quality-related Features**: Encoded on a scale from 1 to 5, ranging from Poor to Excellent, covering 10 features.
   - **Good-to-Bad Features**: Assigned values from low to high quality across 7 features.
   - **Other Features**: Encoded appropriately based on their role in modeling.

After encoding, we saved the transformed dataset as `encoding_data.csv` for modeling use.

---

## 4. Data Splitting

The processed data was split into training and test sets with an 85/15 ratio. This larger training set size enhances model learning, particularly given the limited dataset size. To maintain an unbiased evaluation, we applied data augmentation only to the training data, leaving the test set untouched as a representative sample for real-world cases.

---

## 5. Feature Selection

After data splitting, we identified relevant features for predicting SalePrice using two methods:

### *1. Correlation Analysis*
   - We focused on features with a Pearson’s r correlation coefficient of at least 0.3 with SalePrice. This threshold balances relevance with simplicity, retaining features with moderate associations without over-complicating the model.

### *2. Lasso Regression*
   - To refine feature selection further, we applied Lasso regression, using LassoCV to find the optimal regularization level. Standardized features were used to ensure consistent scaling. We set a high importance threshold of 0.1, and only one feature was removed, reinforcing the relevance of those identified in the correlation analysis.

---

## 6. Data Augmentation

The selected features were passed through the `augment_data_with_perturbations` function for data augmentation, which introduces slight variations in key features. This approach is intended to enhance model generalization by simulating small real-world changes in the data. Key augmentation parameters:

- **Perturbation Percentage**: Set at 0.02 to ensure variations remain within 2% of original feature values, maintaining data realism.
- **Augmented Records**: Generated 2000 synthetic records, balancing data diversity with computational efficiency.

---

## 7. Model Selection and Training

For model selection,  we implemented and compared three regression models to predict house prices. These models were chosen for their ability to handle both simple and complex relationships between features and the target variable, providing a comprehensive evaluation of model performance.

**1. Linear Regression**:

Linear regression serves as a foundational model to establish a baseline for prediction accuracy. It assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable (SalePrice).

Strengths:
Simple and interpretable.
Ideal for datasets exhibiting linear relationships.

Implementation:
Standard linear regression was implemented without regularization to capture the direct influence of features on the target.
Features were standardized before training for consistent model scaling.
Model training and predictions were logged and tracked using MLflow.

**2. Random Forest Regressor**:

Random Forest is an ensemble tree-based model that aggregates predictions from multiple decision trees to reduce variance and improve prediction accuracy.

Strengths:
Handles non-linear relationships and interactions between features effectively.
Robust to overfitting with a proper number of trees (n_estimators).
Capable of ranking feature importance.

Implementation:
Hyperparameters such as the number of trees (n_estimators) were tuned to balance performance and computational cost.
MLflow was used to track the training process, including feature importance and performance.

**3. Elastic Net Regressor**:

Elastic Net is a linear regression model with combined L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization penalties. It balances feature selection and coefficient shrinkage to improve generalization.

Strengths:
Effective when there are correlations among features.
Automatically reduces the impact of less important features.
Combines the strengths of Lasso (sparse feature selection) and Ridge (handles multicollinearity).

Implementation:
Hyperparameters alpha (penalty strength) and l1_ratio (balance between Lasso and Ridge) were fine-tuned.
Elastic Net was chosen to handle the complexity of correlated features identified during feature selection.

---

## 8. Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of our models, we employed a consistent set of evaluation metrics across all three models: Linear Regression, Elastic Net Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. These metrics provide comprehensive insights into the predictive accuracy, error magnitude, and overall model fit.

Metrics Used:

**1. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**

Measures the standard deviation of prediction errors.
Lower RMSE indicates better performance and fewer large prediction errors.

**2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**

Computes the average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
Provides a direct measure of prediction accuracy in the same units as the target variable.

**3. Mean Squared Error (MSE):**

Calculates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
Heavily penalizes larger errors, which makes it useful when avoiding large deviations is critical.

**4. R-squared (R²):**

Evaluates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.
Higher R² values (closer to 1) signify better model fit.

---

## 9. Experimentation and Results

Several experiments were conducted to evaluate feature impact and model configurations. Through these, we achieved:
- An optimal balance between accuracy and complexity.
- Improved performance using data augmentation, which increased model robustness.

2. **Adding Data Files**:
   - Place raw and processed datasets in the `data/` folder.
   - Track each dataset with DVC by running `dvc add data/<filename>`.
   - This creates `.dvc` files (e.g., `AmesHousing.csv.dvc`) that reference the version-controlled data.

3. **Using gitignore.txt and dvcignore.txt**:
   - `gitignore.txt` is used to prevent specific files in `data/` from being tracked by Git.
   - `dvcignore.txt` helps DVC to ignore files or directories in `data/` that you do not want to track.

4. **Pushing Data to Remote Storage**:
   - Configure a remote storage for DVC using `dvc remote add -d <remote-name> <remote-url>`.
   - Push the data to the remote storage with `dvc push` to back up your datasets.

5. **Pulling Data**:
   - To retrieve data from the remote storage, use `dvc pull`.

## Notes

- Ensure that both `gitignore.txt` and `dvcignore.txt` are properly configured to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
- For collaborative projects, share `.dvc` files and configuration, allowing others to reproduce your work by using `dvc pull` to fetch the data.
